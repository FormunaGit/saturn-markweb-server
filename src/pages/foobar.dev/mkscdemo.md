# foobar.dev/mkscdemo

This page demonstrates the **M**ar**ksc**ript language, a simple scripting language where each file is a "module" and must contain a `return` statement.
To use it in a Markweb page, encase the name of the module, minus the `.mksc` extension, in double curly braces.

If my implementation of Markscript works, and the server didn't go haywire, the next line should say "Hello, world!".
